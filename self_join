#4
The query shown gives the number of routes that visit either London Road (149) or Craiglockhart (53). 
Run the query and notice the two services that link these stops have a count of 2. 
Add a HAVING clause to restrict the output to these two routes.

SELECT company, num, COUNT(*)
FROM route WHERE stop=149 OR stop=53
GROUP BY company, num
having count(*)=2

#5
Execute the self join shown and observe that b.stop gives all the places you can get to from Craiglockhart, without changing routes. 
Change the query so that it shows the services from Craiglockhart to London Road.

SELECT a.company, a.num, a.stop, b.stop
FROM route a JOIN route b ON
  (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
WHERE a.stop = (SELECT id FROM stops WHERE name = 'Craiglockhart') AND b.stop = (SELECT id FROM stops WHERE name = 'London Road')

#6
The query shown is similar to the previous one, 
however by joining two copies of the stops table we can refer to stops by name rather than by number. 
Change the query so that the services between 'Craiglockhart' and 'London Road' are shown.

SELECT a.company, a.num, stopa.name, stopb.name
FROM route a JOIN route b ON
  (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
  JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop=stopa.id)
  JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop=stopb.id)
WHERE stopa.name='Craiglockhart' and stopb.name='London Road' 

#10
Find the routes involving two buses that can go from Craiglockhart to Sighthill.
Show the bus no. and company for the first bus, the name of the stop for the transfer,
and the bus no. and company for the second bus.
Hint
Self-join twice to find buses that visit Craiglockhart and Sighthill, then join those on matching stops.

select table1.first_num, table1.first_comp, table1.first_name, table2.snd_num, table2.snd_comp
from  
(select distinct a.company as first_comp, a.num as first_num, d.name as first_name
from route a join route b 
on ( a.company=b.company and a.num=b.num) 
join stops c on (c.id=a.stop)
join stops d on (d.id=b.stop)
where c.name='Craiglockhart') as table1 
join
(select distinct a.company as snd_comp, a.num as snd_num, d.name as snd_name 
from route a join route b 
on ( a.company=b.company and a.num=b.num) 
join stops c on (c.id=a.stop)
join stops d on (d.id=b.stop)
where c.name='Sighthill') as table2 
on 
table1.first_name=table2.snd_name
