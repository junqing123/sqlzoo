#5
Show the name and the population of each country in Europe. Show the population as a percentage of the population of Germany.
Decimal places
You can use the function ROUND to remove the decimal places.
Percent symbol %
You can use the function CONCAT to add the percentage symbol.

SELECT name, CONCAT(ROUND(population*100/(SELECT population FROM world WHERE name = 'Germany'), 0), '%')
FROM world
WHERE continent = 'Europe'
#
We can use the word ALL to allow >= or > or < or <=to act over a list. 
For example, you can find the largest country in the world, by population with this query:

SELECT name
  FROM world
 WHERE population >= ALL(SELECT population
                           FROM world
                          WHERE population>0)
You need the condition population>0 in the sub-query as some countries have null for population.                       
#7
Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area:

select continent, name, area  
from world b
where area>=all (select area 
                 from world a 
                 where area>0 and a.continent=b.continent)
The above example is known as a correlated or synchronized sub-query.
